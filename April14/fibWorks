;;  Fibonacci
;;
;;  This program prints the first 25 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
;;  Each number is followed by a newline character.
;;
;;  The following list describes the register usage of this program:
;;  r1  => Holds the number that will be printed during the current iteration.
;;  r2  => Holds the number that will be printed during the next iteration.
;;  r3  => A counter from 0..24. Determines the number of Fibonacci Sequence 
;;  r4  => Holds a newline character.
;;         values that will be printed.
;;  r5  => Used to swap r1 and r2 each iteration.

;  Setup
;
movi r1, $0   ; declare 0 as the first number in the sequence
movi r2, $1   ; declare 1 as the second number in the sequence
movi r3, $0   ; initialize iteration counter to 0
movi r4, $10  ; store newline character

;
;  Start of loop
;
cmpi r3, $25  ; start of loop, while r3 != 25
jei  $3     ; if r3 != 25, continue loop
jmpi $24   ; if r3 == 25, jump to 'exit' instruction

printr r1    ; print the current number in the sequence
printcr r4   ; print newline character

addr r1, r2   ; calculate the next value, store the result in r1

movr r5, r1   ; These three instructions
movr r1, r2   ; swap the values of
movr r2, r5   ; r1 and r2.

incr r3      ; keep count of the number of iterations in r3

jmpi $-33   ; unconditionally jump to top of loop (cmpi)

;
;  End of loop
;
exit         ; terminates program
