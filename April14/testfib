;;  Fibonacci
;;
;;  This program prints the first 25 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
;;  Each number is followed by a newline character.
;;
;;  The following list describes the register usage of this program:
;;  r1  => Holds the number that will be printed during the current iteration.
;;  r2  => Holds the number that will be printed during the next iteration.
;;  r3  => A counter from 0..24. Determines the number of Fibonacci Sequence 
;;  r4  => Holds a newline character.
;;         values that will be printed.
;;  r5  => Used to swap r1 and r2 each iteration.
